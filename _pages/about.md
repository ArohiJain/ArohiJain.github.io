I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), NY. My research focuses on plasma physics and laser-plasma interactions, particularly in the areas of plasma accelerators and laser wakefield acceleration. I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from the Department of Physics & Astrophysics at [University of Delhi](http://physics.du.ac.in/) in 2022, where I worked on the control and optimization of laser wakefield acceleration under the guidance of Prof. D. N. Gupta. Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. (2014-2016) and B.Sc. (2011-2014) in Physics from Miranda House, University of Delhi.

**Research Interest:**
* Plasma Physics
* Numerical and Theoretical Modeling of Laser-Plasma Interactions
* Plasma Accelerators
* Laser Wakefield Acceleration
* Laser Driven Terahertz Generation
* PIC Simulation
